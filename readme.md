Core - A Fine Foundation for JavaScript Projects
================================================

Core prepares the ground for JavaScript projects. It fills what is missing, fixes what is wrong, adds what is useful. While doing this it is still a pretty lightweight framework which is a good start for all kind of JavaScript projects.

Core was designed to work together with the JavaScript tooling project [Jasy](https://github.com/sebastian-software/jasy).

## Creating Projects

Core offers a skeleton project for being used via `jasy create`. This allows for an easy usage of Jasy and Core and offers a good set of typical tasks pre-configured for your use. To create a new project execute the following after [Jasy has been installed](https://github.com/sebastian-software/jasy/wiki#installation).:

```bash
jasy create --name myproject --origin https://github.com/sebastian-software/core.git --skeleton application
```

Note: Replace `myproject` with the name of the project (lowecase characters, no spaces) you want to create. A new directory called `myproject` will be created for you.


## Jasy Compatibility

This project is kept compatible with newest development of the [Jasy](http://github.com/sebastian-software/jasy) tooling framework. This means that the newest GitHub versions typically require a recent Jasy version  as well. Take a look at this list to understand what version to choose from:

* **1.5**: Jasy = 1.5.x
* **0.9**: Jasy = 0.8.x
* **0.8**: Jasy = 0.8.x
* **0.7**: Jasy = 0.7.x
* **0.6**: Jasy = 0.6.x
* **0.5**: Jasy = 0.5.x
